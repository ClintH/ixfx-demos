/**
 * ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain Release) envelope. An envelope is a value that changes over time,
 * usually in response to an intial trigger.
 *
 * Created with the {@link adsr} function. [See the ixfx Guide on Envelopes](https://clinth.github.io/ixfx-docs/modulation/envelope/).
 *
 * @example Setup
 * ```js
 * import { Envelopes } from 'https://unpkg.com/ixfx/dist/modulation.js'
 * const opts = {
 *  ...Envelopes.defaultAdsrOpts(),
 *  attackDuration: 1000,
 *  decayDuration: 200,
 *  sustainDuration: 100
 * }
 * const env = Envelopes.adsr(opts);
 * ```
 *
 * [Options for envelope](https://clinth.github.io/ixfx/types/Modulation.Envelopes.AdsrOpts.html) are as follows:
 *
 * ```js
 * initialLevel?: number
 * attackBend: number
 * attackDuration: number
 * decayBend: number
 * decayDuration:number
 * sustainLevel: number
 * releaseBend: number
 * releaseDuration: number
 * releaseLevel?: number
 * peakLevel: number
 * retrigger?: boolean
 * shouldLoop: boolean
 * ```
 *
 * If `retrigger` is false, re-triggers will continue at current level
 * rather than resetting to `initialLevel`.
 *
 * If `shouldLoop` is true, envelope loops until `release()` is called.
 *
 * @example Using
 * ```js
 * env.trigger(); // Start envelope
 * ...
 * // Get current value of envelope
 * const [state, scaled, raw] = env.compute();
 * ```
 *
 * * `state` is a string, one of the following: 'attack', 'decay', 'sustain', 'release', 'complete'
 * * `scaled` is a value scaled according to the stage's _levels_
 * * `raw` is the progress from 0 to 1 within a stage. ie. 0.5 means we're halfway through a stage.
 *
 * Instead of `compute()`, most usage of the envelope is just fetching the `value` property, which returns the same scaled value of `compute()`:
 *
 * ```js
 * const value = env.value; // Get scaled number
 * ```
 *
 * @example Hold & release
 * ```js
 * env.trigger(true);   // Pass in true to hold
 * ...envelope will stop at sustain stage...
 * env.release();      // Release into decay
 * ```
 *
 * Check if it's done:
 *
 * ```js
 * env.isDone; // True if envelope is completed
 * ```
 *
 * Envelope has events to track activity: 'change' and 'complete':
 *
 * ```
 * env.addEventListener(`change`, ev => {
 *  console.log(`Old: ${evt.oldState} new: ${ev.newState}`);
 * })
 * ```
