 *
 * Eg, Let's create a debounced wrapped for a function:
 * ```js
 * const fn = () => console.log('Hello');
 * const debouncedFn = debounce(fn, 1000);
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can call `debouncedFn()` as often as we like, but it will only execute
 * `fn()` after 1 second has elapsed since the last invocation. It essentially filters
 * many calls to fewer calls. Each time `debounceFn()` is called, the timeout is
 * reset, so potentially `fn` could never be called if the rate of `debounceFn` being called
 * is faster than the provided timeout.
 *
 * Remember that to benefit from `debounce`, you must call the debounced wrapper, not the original function.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Create
 * const d = debounce(fn, 1000);
 *
 * // Don't do this if we want to benefit from the debounce
 * fn();
 *
 * // Use the debounced wrapper
 * d(); // Only calls fn after 1000s
 * ```
 *
 * A practical use for this is handling high-frequency streams of data, where we don't really
 * care about processing every event, only last event after a period. Debouncing is commonly
 * used on microcontrollers to prevent button presses being counted twice.
 *
 * @example Handle most recent pointermove event after 1000ms
 * ```js
 * // Set up debounced handler
 * const moveDebounced = debounce((elapsedMs, evt) => {
 *    // Handle event
 * }, 500);
 *
 * // Wire up event
 * el.addEventListener(`pointermove`, moveDebounced);
 * ```
 *
 * Arguments can be passed to the debounced function:
 *
 * ```js
 * const fn = (x) => console.log(x);
 * const d = debounce(fn, 1000);
 * d(10);
 * ```
 *
 * If the provided function is asynchronous, it's possible to await the debounced
 * version as well. If the invocation was filtered, it returns instantly.
 *
 * ```js
 * const d = debounce(fn, 1000);
 * await d();
 * ```
 * @param callback Function to filter access to
 * @param timeoutMs Minimum time between invocations
 * @returns Debounce function
