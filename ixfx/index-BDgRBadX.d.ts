/**
 * Returns a debounce function which acts to filter calls to a given function `fn`.
 *
 * Eg, Let's create a debounced wrapped for a function:
 * ```js
 * const fn = () => console.log('Hello');
 * const debouncedFn = debounce(fn, 1000);
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can call `debouncedFn()` as often as we like, but it will only execute
 * `fn()` after 1 second has elapsed since the last invocation. It essentially filters
 * many calls to fewer calls. Each time `debounceFn()` is called, the timeout is
 * reset, so potentially `fn` could never be called if the rate of `debounceFn` being called
 * is faster than the provided timeout.
 *
 * Remember that to benefit from `debounce`, you must call the debounced wrapper, not the original function.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Create
 * const d = debounce(fn, 1000);
 *
 * // Don't do this if we want to benefit from the debounce
 * fn();
 *
 * // Use the debounced wrapper
 * d(); // Only calls fn after 1000s
 * ```
 *
 * A practical use for this is handling high-frequency streams of data, where we don't really
 * care about processing every event, only last event after a period. Debouncing is commonly
 * used on microcontrollers to prevent button presses being counted twice.
 *
 * @example Handle most recent pointermove event after 1000ms
 * ```js
 * // Set up debounced handler
 * const moveDebounced = debounce((elapsedMs, evt) => {
 *    // Handle event
 * }, 500);
 *
 * // Wire up event
 * el.addEventListener(`pointermove`, moveDebounced);
 * ```
 *
 * Arguments can be passed to the debounced function:
 *
 * ```js
 * const fn = (x) => console.log(x);
 * const d = debounce(fn, 1000);
 * d(10);
 * ```
 *
 * If the provided function is asynchronous, it's possible to await the debounced
 * version as well. If the invocation was filtered, it returns instantly.
 *
 * ```js
 * const d = debounce(fn, 1000);
 * await d();
 * ```
 * @param callback Function to filter access to
 * @param interval Minimum time between invocations
 * @returns Debounce function

 * Matches responses with requests, expiring requests if they do not get a response in a timely manner.
 *
 * Basic usage:
 * ```js
 * const m = new RequestResponseMatch(options);
 * // Listen for when a response matches a request
 * m.addEventListener(`match`, event => {
 *  // event: { request:Req, response:Resp}
 * });
 * // Or alternatively, listen for success and failures

 *  // { request:Resp, response:Req|undefined, success:boolean }
 *  // 'response' will be data or a string error message
 * });
 * m.request(req); // Note that some request was sent
 * ...
 * m.response(resp); // Call when a response is received
 * ```
 *
 * It's also possible to wait for specific replies:
 * ```js
 * // With a promise
 * const resp = await m.requestAwait(req);
 * // With a callback
 * m.requestCallback(req, (success, resp) => {
 *  // Runs on success or failure
 * })
 * ```
 * It relies on creating an id of a request/response for them to be matched up. Use the `key`
 * option if the function can generate a key from either request or response. Or alternatively set both `keyRequest` and `keyResponse` for two functions that can generate a key for request and response respectively.
 *
 *
 * The easy case is if req & resp both have the same field:
 * ```js
 * const m = new RequestResponseMatch({
 *  key: (reqOrResp) => {
 *    // Requests has an 'id' field
 *    // Response also has an 'id' field that corresponds to the request id
 *    return reqOrResp.id;
 *  }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A more complicated case:
 * ```js
 * const m = new RequestResponseMatch({
 *  keyRequest: (req) => {
 *    // Requests have an 'id' field
 *    return req.id;
 *  },
 *  keyResponse: (resp) => {
 *    // Responses have id under a different field
 *    return resp.reply_to
 *  }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * By default, error will be thrown if a response is received that doesn't match up to any request.

 * to be notified if it was canceled or completes.
 *
 * It does not execute or track the outcome of execution itself. Rather it's a bit
 * of machinery that needs to be steered by your own logic.
 *
 * `waitFor` takes a timeout, and two lifecycle functions, `onAborted` and `onComplete`.
 * `onAborted` is called if the timeout has elapsed. `onComplete` will run on either success or failure.
 *
 * ```js
 * waitFor(1000,
 * (error) => {
 *  // Failed
 * },
 * (success) => {
 *  if (success) {
 *    // Succeeded
 *  }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When calling `waitFor` you get back a function to signal success or failure:
 * ```js
 * const done = waitFor(1000, onAborted, onComplete);
 * done();          // No parameters signals success
 * done('failed');  // A string parameter indicates failure
 * ```
 *
 * @example Compact
 * ```js
 * const done = waitFor(1000,
 *  (reason) => {
 *    console.log(`Aborted: ${reason}`);
 *  });
 *
 * try {
 *  runSomethingThatMightScrewUp();
 *  done(); // Signal it succeeded
 * } catch (e) {
 *  done(e); // Signal there was an error
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Verbose
 * ```js
 * // This function is called by `waitFor` if it was cancelled
 * const onAborted = (reason:string) => {
 *  // 'reason' is a string describing why it has aborted.
 *  // ie: due to timeout or because done() was called with an error
 * };
 *
 * // This function is called by `waitFor` if it completed
 * const onComplete = (success:boolean) => {
 *  // Called if we were aborted or finished succesfully.
 *  // onComplete will be called after onAborted, if it was an error case
 * }
 *
 * // If done() is not called after 1000, onAborted will be called
 * // if done() is called or there was a timeout, onComplete is called
 * const done = waitFor(1000, onAborted, onComplete);
 *
 * // Signal completed successfully (thus calling onComplete(true))
 * done();
 *
 * // Signal there was an error (thus calling onAborted and onComplete(false))
