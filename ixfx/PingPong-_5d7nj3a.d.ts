/**
 * Continually loops up and down between 0 and 1 by a specified interval.
 * Looping returns start value, and is inclusive of 0 and 1.
 *
 * @example Usage
 * ```js
 * import {percentPingPong} from 'https://unpkg.com/ixfx/dist/modulation.js';
 * for (const v of percentPingPong(0.1)) {
 *  // v will go up and down. Make sure you have a break somewhere because it is infinite
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Alternative:
 * ```js
 * const pp = pingPongPercent(0.1, 0.5); // Setup generator one time
 * const v = pp.next().value; // Call .next().value whenever a new value is needed
 * ```
 *
 * Because limits are capped to -1 to 1, using large intervals can produce uneven distribution. Eg an interval of 0.8 yields 0, 0.8, 1
 *
 * `upper` and `lower` define the percentage range. Eg to ping pong between 40-60%:
 * ```
 * const pp = pingPongPercent(0.1, 0.4, 0.6);
 * ```
 * @param interval Amount to increment by. Defaults to 10%
 * @param start Starting point within range. Defaults to 0 using a positive interval or 1 for negative intervals
 * @param rounding Rounding to apply. This avoids floating-point rounding errors.
 */

/**
 * Ping-pongs continually back and forth `start` and `end` with a given `interval`. Use `pingPongPercent` for 0-1 ping-ponging
 *
 * In a loop:
 * ```
 * for (const c of pingPong(10, 0, 100)) {
 *  // 0, 10, 20 .. 100, 90, 80, 70 ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Manual:
 * ```
 * const pp = pingPong(10, 0, 100);
 * let v = pp.next().value; // Call .next().value whenever a new value is needed
 * ```
 * @param interval Amount to increment by. Use negative numbers to start counting down
 * @param lower Lower bound (inclusive)
 * @param upper Upper bound (inclusive, must be greater than start)
 * @param start Starting point within bounds (defaults to `lower`)
 * @param rounding Rounding is off by default. Use say 1000 if interval is a fractional amount to avoid rounding errors.
