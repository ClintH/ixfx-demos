# head

This basic demo demonstrates:
1. Receiving pose data of one or more bodies
2. Deriving data from raw pose data
3. Mapping to screen coordinates
4. Drawing on the canvas.

It is limited because it mirrors the data to the canvas.

We use two provided helper files `PosesTracker.js` and `PoseTracker.js`, contained in the parent folder. This help with data housekeeping, and shouldn't need to be changed.
