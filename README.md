## Getting started

### Editing and running locally (recommended)

There are two versions of the demo repository.

* _ixfx-demos_ includes a copy of ixfx. This is useful for working offline and the recommended approach. 
* _ixfx-demos-light_ is a mirror of this, without the ixfx build and with all sketches using a online, hosted version of ixfx. This is useful when using a web-based IDE.
