# Debugging

First, you probably want to make sure you're up and running with [accessing your sketches remotely](./ngrok.md).

# Android

To debug your sketches running on an Android device, make sure you're using Chrome, and [follow these instructions to set up remote debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/).

# iPhone/iPad

To debug your sketches running on an iPhone or iPad your machine must be a Mac. You can do so via Safari.

The initial setup requires a cabled connection to your laptop, but after that it's possible to do it wirelessly.
